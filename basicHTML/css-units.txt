px => absolute value no matter where it is defined
% =>  relative to parent 

viewport units:
vw & vh => percent value of entire screen but unlike percentage it does not obey parent 


font specific units: 

rem => relative to root like (normal pixels for screen its constant throught)
em => relative to parent font size (better to avoid it, beahves similar to percentage unit)
